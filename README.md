## Data Engineering Fundamentals

---

This repository is designed to explore the core concepts of data engineering through hands-on, small mini-projects. These projects will cover fundamental aspects of data engineering, from database schema design to big data technologies, cloud platforms, and more. The primary programming language for this exploration will be **Python**, with opportunities to incorporate **Java** and **Scala** where relevant.

## Objectives

- **Practical Exploration**: Each project will focus on a specific concept, providing both theoretical explanations and practical implementations.
- **Language Proficiency**: Emphasis on Python for most tasks, with some exploration into Java and Scala for relevant topics.
- **End-to-End Pipeline**: Learn how to move data from raw formats to well-structured, optimized systems ready for analysis.
- **Industry-Relevant Skills**: Focus on real-world tools and platforms used in the data engineering field.

## Core Concepts

This repository will dive into the following 10 key data engineering areas:

1. **Data Modeling**: 
   - Designing efficient and scalable database schemas.
   - Explore normalization, denormalization, and entity-relationship diagrams.
   
2. **ETL Pipelines**:
   - Building efficient **Extract, Transform, Load (ETL)** processes.
   - Automating data ingestion, transformation, and loading into target systems.
   
3. **SQL**:
   - Writing complex queries and managing relational databases.
   - Focus on query optimization and database performance tuning.
   
4. **Data Warehousing**:
   - Exploring cloud-based data warehousing solutions like **Snowflake** and **Redshift**.
   - Structuring data warehouses for efficient analytics.
   
5. **Big Data Technologies**:
   - Introduction to distributed systems like **Hadoop**, **Spark**, and **Kafka**.
   - Working with large datasets in a distributed environment.
   
6. **Cloud Platforms**:
   - Data engineering in the cloud using platforms like **AWS**, **Google Cloud**, and **Azure**.
   - Understanding the best practices for scalability and cost-efficiency.
   
7. **Data Governance**:
   - Implementing data governance strategies, including data security, privacy, and quality.
   - Ensuring compliance with industry standards.
   
8. **Programming in Python/Java/Scala**:
   - Using **Python** as the primary language for building data pipelines.
   - Exploring **Java** and **Scala** for distributed systems and big data technologies.
   
9. **APIs and Data Integration**:
   - Designing and consuming APIs for data integration.
   - Handling batch and real-time data processing using REST and streaming APIs.
   
10. **Version Control and Automation**:
   - Using **Git** for version control.
   - Automating workflows and deployment using **CI/CD** tools.

## Project Structure

Each folder in this repository represents a mini-project focused on one of the core data engineering concepts. Each project includes:

- A brief explanation of the concept.
- A step-by-step implementation using Python (and occasionally Java/Scala).
- Instructions for setting up and running the project.
- An overview of the challenges and best practices related to the concept.

### Example Projects

- **Schema Design & SQL Optimization**: Explore designing and optimizing schemas for efficient querying.
- **Building an ETL Pipeline**: Implement an end-to-end ETL process using Python to transform and load data into a database.
- **Spark for Big Data Processing**: Use **Apache Spark** to process large datasets in a distributed environment.
- **Data Warehouse on Snowflake**: Set up and query a cloud-based data warehouse.
- **Real-time Data Streaming with Kafka**: Learn how to process real-time streaming data using **Kafka**.
- **Data Governance Strategies**: Best practices for ensuring data quality and security in cloud environments.

## Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
