   - Exploring cloud-based data warehousing solutions like **Snowflake** and **Redshift**.
   - Structuring data warehouses for efficient analytics.
   
5. **Big Data Technologies**:
   - Introduction to distributed systems like **Hadoop**, **Spark**, and **Kafka**.
   - Working with large datasets in a distributed environment.
   
6. **Cloud Platforms**:
   - Data engineering in the cloud using platforms like **AWS**, **Google Cloud**, and **Azure**.
   - Understanding the best practices for scalability and cost-efficiency.
   
7. **Data Governance**:
   - Implementing data governance strategies, including data security, privacy, and quality.
   - Ensuring compliance with industry standards.
   
8. **Programming in Python/Java/Scala**:
   - Using **Python** as the primary language for building data pipelines.
   - Exploring **Java** and **Scala** for distributed systems and big data technologies.
   
9. **APIs and Data Integration**:
   - Designing and consuming APIs for data integration.
   - Handling batch and real-time data processing using REST and streaming APIs.
   
10. **Version Control and Automation**:
   - Using **Git** for version control.
   - Automating workflows and deployment using **CI/CD** tools.

## Project Structure

Each folder in this repository represents a mini-project focused on one of the core data engineering concepts. Each project includes:

- A brief explanation of the concept.
- A step-by-step implementation using Python (and occasionally Java/Scala).
- Instructions for setting up and running the project.
- An overview of the challenges and best practices related to the concept.

### Example Projects

- **Schema Design & SQL Optimization**: Explore designing and optimizing schemas for efficient querying.
- **Building an ETL Pipeline**: Implement an end-to-end ETL process using Python to transform and load data into a database.
- **Spark for Big Data Processing**: Use **Apache Spark** to process large datasets in a distributed environment.
- **Data Warehouse on Snowflake**: Set up and query a cloud-based data warehouse.
- **Real-time Data Streaming with Kafka**: Learn how to process real-time streaming data using **Kafka**.
- **Data Governance Strategies**: Best practices for ensuring data quality and security in cloud environments.
